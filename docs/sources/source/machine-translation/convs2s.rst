ConvS2S
===================

Model
~~~~~
We have 2 models  based on `Facebook ConvS2S model <https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45610>`_ (see  `Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Learnin <>`_  by Jonas Gehring etal ). This mdoel based on convolutional neural networks + attention.
 
* baseline Conv2S2 model (config `en-de-convs2s.py <https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenSeq2Seq/blob/master/example_configs/text2text/tbd>`_ ),
  which has ....

This model achieve BLEU score 20.23 on WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task 
  ( `checkpoint  <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ty9hiOQx4V28jJmIbj7FWUyw7LVA39SF/view?usp=sharing>`_ ).
